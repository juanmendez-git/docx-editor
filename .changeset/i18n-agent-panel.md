Translate agent panel UI strings — wires `AgentPanel`, `AgentChatLog`, `AgentTimeline`, and `AgentComposer` through `t()` and ships full translations for `de`, `pl`, and `pt-BR`. Previously `agentPanel.*` keys were `null` in every non-English locale, and the chat primitives hardcoded strings like "Working… N steps", "Assistant is thinking", "Ask the assistant…", "Send", and "Resize agent panel".
